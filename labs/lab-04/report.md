# Lab 04 Report - Licensing

1. [LICENSE link](LICENSE.md)

2. Four freedoms of Free Software: you can use the program for any purpose, you can study the code and modify it to serve a new purpose, you can redistribute the code to others, and you can (and should) share modifications to the code to others.

3. It's important to consider licensing in an open-source project for a number of reasons: ensure others can help you with as few barriers as possible, to protect yourself legally, and to contribute to the free software community in a responsible way. You should license your software so that everyone can be sure of what they're allowed to do with your code and to remove any barriers that allow you and others to contribute to the greater OSS community.

4. Any code without a clear license is a red flag, because it is unclear what the distribution permissions for others are. You could be at risk of legal trouble if you redistribute this code or if you work on unlicensed open source programs. A missing license demonstrates the creator(s)' lack of familiarity with the rules and etiquette of responsibe open-source projects, and could put collaborators at risk of legal trouble.

5. I think the conflict pointed out in the article reflect the complexities of open-source projects in general. Open-source vs. propietary software differ in their philosophy about collaborative development and the discussion goes further than Gopher vs. the Web or even software development. Even after reading the article by Lee, I don't feel qualified enough to agree or disagree with their reasoning about the closed system ideology dooming Gopher, but in my opinion creating barriers in communities like these will always lead to eventual loss of interest by the enthusiasts who drive the whole community.

6. For the Android Open Source Project, their documentation explains plainly why they've chosen the Apache license over other licenses like LGPL. According to them, their main focus in licensing is to keep collaboration as easy as possible and remove any legal and engineering roadblocks that more restrictive licenses can raise. Their stated goal is to keep things as free and open as possible, without forcing developers to follow extensive guidelines to explain modifications or train engineers on compliance problems.
